<p>Ever since it was built more than a century ago, the Custis-Lee
Mansion has dominated the scene across the river from the
National Capital. An outstanding example of a Greek Revival
building of the early nineteenth century, its dignity and strength, simplicity
and steady grace, now make it a most appropriate national
memorial to one of America&rsquo;s greatest men, Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>Built by his father-in-law, George Washington Parke Custis, the
adopted son of General Washington, the mansion was for many years
a principal repository of many objects associated with George Washington.
As such, it greatly influenced Robert E. Lee when the building
was his home. Like him, it experienced the vicissitudes of war and
came to be associated with his fame. Now it is maintained by the
Nation in his honor, and in the years to come will serve as a constant
reminder of his nobility and greatness.</p>
<p>Many years have passed since General Lee lived in the home at Arlington.
But so real are the memories evoked by its historic atmosphere, it
seems little more than yesterday that he left it for the last time. A visit
to the Custis-Lee Mansion gives a deeper, more personal understanding
of the life and worth of the man to whose memory it is now dedicated.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small"><i>History of Arlington to 1861</i></span></h2>
<p><span class="small">ANCESTRY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON PARKE CUSTIS.</span> George Washington
Parke Custis was born April 30, 1781. His mother was Eleanor
(Calvert) Custis, a granddaughter of the sixth Lord Baltimore; his father,
John Parke Custis, the only son of Martha Washington by her first
marriage. John Parke Custis grew to manhood at Mount Vernon, married
Eleanor Calvert in 1774, and died of camp fever in 1781 while
serving as aide to General Washington at Yorktown. His death left four
children fatherless, so the two youngest, George Washington Parke
Custis and his sister Eleanor, were adopted by the Washingtons and
taken to Mount Vernon to be raised as their own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">HIS EARLY LIFE AT MOUNT VERNON.</span> Only 6 months old when he was
taken to live at Mount Vernon, it was a remarkable experience for a boy
as sensitive and gifted as young Custis to grow up on terms of intimacy
with General Washington, whose affection the fatherless lad reciprocated
with the deepest love and respect. As far as public duties would
allow, the General supervised the training and education of the boy, who
acquired from him the interests and ideals which established the pattern
of his life. &ldquo;It is really an enjoyment to be here to witness the tranquil
happiness that reigns throughout the house,&rdquo; wrote a guest at Mount
Vernon in 1799, &ldquo;except when now and then a little bustle is occasioned
by the young Squire Custis when he returns from hunting, bringing in
a &lsquo;valiant deer&rsquo;, as he terms it, that Grandpa and the Colonel will devour:
nice venison I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">GEORGE WASHINGTON PARKE CUSTIS MOVES TO ARLINGTON.</span> Custis
was 18 when the General died in 1799. Mrs. Washington did not long
survive her husband, and when she died, early in 1802, Custis moved to
&ldquo;Mount Washington,&rdquo; as he first called the Arlington estate. This was
a tract of nearly 1,100 acres that Custis&rsquo; father had bought in 1778 with
the intention of establishing a family seat convenient to Mount Vernon,
but in 1802 the only tangible remains of his brief ownership were the
flourishing willows he had planted along the Potomac.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">&ldquo;ARLINGTON HOUSE&rdquo; BEGUN.</span> When Custis moved into a cottage built
by the former owners of the property, Arlington consisted mostly of
woodland and virgin oak forests, with a few cleared fields near the river.
His first concern was to get the fields under cultivation, using for the
purpose the mules and farm equipment he had purchased at the sales
held that year at Mount Vernon to settle the legacies of the several
Washington heirs. Equally urgent was the need to build a house worthy
of the furnishings and mementoes which he had inherited or bought at
the Mount Vernon sales, some of which were deteriorating badly in their
temporary quarters. To this end, he seems to have obtained building
plans from George Hadfield, a gifted young architect, who had come
from England in 1795 to take charge of the construction of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Influenced by the contemporary vogue for classical architecture, Custis
wanted his house to be in the new style, and the architect&rsquo;s finished
design was a simplified Greek Doric portico balanced by extended wings,
the whole of such sturdiness as to show to advantage when viewed from
across the river. Since ornamentation would be lost at such a distance,
the architect largely dispensed with it, relying on good proportions to
give beauty to his creation. Rooms would be large and have high ceilings
and tall windows, and their severely plain walls would be perfect
for displaying the many portraits Custis possessed. Having the rooms
open into each other would give extensive vistas, framed by pleasing
semicircular arches.</p>

<p>Though clay for bricks and choice timber were at hand on his estate,
Custis lacked the money necessary to build his house all at once. Therefore
he followed the common practice of building the wings first, and
the main section later. The north wing was built about 1803, and was
evidently intended to be one great banquet room. By 1804, the south
wing was completed, containing an office and a large room for entertaining.
In that year Custis married Mary Lee Fitzhugh. To provide
living quarters for himself and his bride he had the north wing partitioned
into three small rooms. With a kitchen and laundry in the
basement, the young couple had the essentials of living at &ldquo;Arlington
House,&rdquo; as Custis named his new home, after the old family seat on the
Eastern Shore. At this point, work seems to have been stopped. A visitor
reported in 1811, &ldquo;I was struck, on entering the grounds of Mr. Custis,
at Arlington, ... with several of the most picturesque views. This seat
is on a superb mount, and his buildings are begun in a stile of superior
taste and elegance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">ARLINGTON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE.</span>
While building his house, Custis inaugurated an annual fair designed to
improve agricultural practices in general, and particularly the breeding
of fine-wooled sheep. Beginning in 1803, Custis invited the local gentry
each spring to exhibit their best sheep and homespun cloth at Arlington
Spring, near the edge of the river. After prizes had been awarded, the fair
would close with patriotic speeches and a great dinner under the tent
which had been used by Washington during the Revolution.</p>

<p class="pcap">&ldquo;ARLINGTON HOUSE,&rdquo; AS IT APPEARED FROM ABOUT 1804-1816</p>
</div>
<p>By breeding the native stock on his farms with the imported stock he
had acquired from Mount Vernon, Custis himself developed a hardy race
of fine-wooled sheep, known as the &ldquo;Arlington Improved.&rdquo; Because the
wool of this breed could be woven into finer cloth than hitherto possible,
the Arlington sheep were widely diffused throughout the country. Custis
also sought to correct the primitive agricultural methods which had
already caused much land in his State to be abandoned because of soil
erosion. He advocated the establishment of a National Board of Agriculture
with functions like those of the Department of Agriculture today,
and he offered one of his outlying properties for use as an experimental
breeding station. So popular was the Arlington Sheepshearing, as it was
commonly called, that the idea was quickly adopted elsewhere. Though
economic conditions forced Custis to discontinue the event after 1812,
it was one of the primary sources of the great program of agricultural
improvement in effect today.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">BIRTH OF MARY ANNA RANDOLPH CUSTIS.</span> Mary Anna Randolph Custis,
born in 1808, was the only one of the four Custis children to survive the
first year of infancy. Upon her the parents centered their affections and
hopes. The mother&rsquo;s natural piety and devotion to her family were
deepened by the loss of her other children, while the father&rsquo;s warm and
generous nature was such that in later years she could not recall ever
having received an unkind word from him.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">CUSTIS AND THE WAR OF 1812.</span> During the War of 1812, the British
blockade of the Chesapeake deprived Custis of much of the income from
his other estates, so it is doubtful if any building was done at Arlington
at this time. Convinced that Napoleon threatened the liberties of mankind
more than England, Custis strongly opposed the war. For this
reason he was chosen to deliver the funeral oration for General Lingan,
a veteran of the Revolution who was murdered by the same Baltimore
mob which almost killed Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Light-Horse Harry&rdquo;
Lee. Nevertheless, Custis followed the example set by George Washington
during the American Revolution by forbidding the managers of
his plantations to furnish supplies to the British; and when British
troops approached the National Capital in 1814, Custis fought in the
ranks at the battle of Bladensburg.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">&ldquo;ARLINGTON HOUSE&rdquo; COMPLETED.</span> After the war, Custis resumed work
on his house, and the large center section and great portico were to
have been finished in 1817. &ldquo;A house that any one might see with half
an eye,&rdquo; as Robert E. Lee later described it, could not fail to attract attention,
and &ldquo;Custis&rsquo; Folly&rdquo; is first mentioned by a traveler in 1818.
Although the interior was never completed as planned and the rear was
left unstuccoed, &ldquo;Arlington House&rdquo; was soon considered one of the
handsomest residences about Washington. One early writer describes it
as &ldquo;a noble-looking place, having a portico of stately white columns,
which, as the mansion stands high, with a back ground of dark woods,
forms a beautiful object in the landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE MEMORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON KEPT ALIVE AT ARLINGTON.</span>
&ldquo;Arlington House&rdquo; now became the successor of Mount Vernon as the
&ldquo;Washington Treasury,&rdquo; as Custis termed it. His collection of Washington
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
relics was the largest in existence, and it filled the halls and rooms
of the mansion. The owner of these relics welcomed all who wished to
view them, and he never tired of entertaining his guests with tales of his
early years at Mount Vernon. Many distinguished men visited Arlington
at one time or other&mdash;Sam Houston, Daniel Webster, and Andrew
Jackson, to name a few. One of the most notable was General Lafayette,
who twice was a guest there when he toured the United States in 1824
and 1825. Custis spent much time with the venerable marquis, and used
the wealth of reminiscenses he gained from the old soldier to write the
delightful <i>Conversations With Lafayette</i>, which was published in a local
newspaper in 1825. Encouraged by their favorable reception, he then
began his own <i>Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington</i>, which
proved equally popular and were widely reprinted in the newspapers of
the period.</p>
<p>Even more successful were the dramas Custis wrote at this time, based
on heroic episodes in the Nation&rsquo;s past or on inspiring contemporary
achievements. <i>The Indian Prophecy</i> used an incident in Washington&rsquo;s
early life as its theme and established a vogue for Indian plays which
lasted over 50 years; while the <i>Rail Road</i> was the first one written on that
subject in America. Others dramatized such events as the battle of Baltimore
and the launching of a new warship. For 10 years his dramatic
pieces were staged from Boston to Charleston and did much to develop
a distinctive American drama.</p>

<p>A man of culture, Custis used all of his abilities to perpetuate the
memory of Washington. He erected the first monument on the President&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
birthplace in 1816, wrote poems to celebrate his greatness, and
painted colorful battle pictures in which the great General was the
central figure. An accomplished orator, he was tireless in advocating
the principles of freedom for which Washington had fought, and
planned to do with his slaves as his foster father had done&mdash;free them
after they had been prepared to shift for themselves. Although he never
held an elective office, his influence was considerable and for the good.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">HOME LIFE AT ARLINGTON.</span> An equal source of inspiration at &ldquo;Arlington
House&rdquo; was the religious atmosphere of its home life. Mrs. Custis
was a devout Episcopalian, noted for her simplicity and piety. It was she
who influenced Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Sunday school teacher, Bishop William
Meade, to enter the ministry. Diligent where her husband was inclined
to be easy-going, Mrs. Custis was one with him in making Arlington
free from ostentation.</p>
<p>Kept unspoiled by her parents&rsquo; example, Mary Custis was given the
education deemed necessary for a young lady of her position, and as soon
as she was old enough herself taught the children of nearby families and
family servants. Though an only child, she never lacked companionship,
for usually the house overflowed with relatives and their children. The
Custises, too, often went visiting, especially to &ldquo;Ravensworth,&rdquo; formerly
the home of Mrs. Custis&rsquo; father and now owned by her only brother.
Here Mary must have played as a child with Robert E. Lee, for he and
his mother were also related to the Fitzhughs and often visited at their
estate. The Lees were familiar with Arlington as well, for Robert was
a favorite with the Custises from boyhood. He and Mary Custis are
said to have planted some of the trees in the vicinity of the house
when they were young.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">MARRIAGE OF MARY CUSTIS AND ROBERT E. LEE.</span> Childhood friendship
turned to love by the time Lee graduated from West Point and was assigned
to duty in the Corps of Engineers. Whenever possible he was at
Arlington courting Mary Custis, and in the summer of 1830 they became
engaged.</p>
<p>The evening of the wedding, June 30, 1831, was one of steady rain, but
nothing could affect the warmth and happiness inside the friendly
portals of Arlington. The ceremony was formal and elaborate as befitted
the union of two of the most prominent families of Virginia. The happy
couple, surrounded by pretty bridesmaids and uniformed groomsmen,
made a picturesque scene.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES AT FORT MONROE, 1831 TO 1834.</span> Wedding trips not being
customary at that time, the young married couple stayed at Arlington
until it was time for them to go to Fort Monroe where Lee was stationed.
At Christmas they returned home, and, because of the bad weather, Mrs.
Lee remained there till spring. Furniture and choice provisions from the
Custis farms helped to make the Lee&rsquo;s quarters at the fort more homelike,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
while Mrs. Custis&rsquo; frequent letters lessened her daughter&rsquo;s homesickness,
as did the whimsical, chatty ones her father wrote regularly to
his &ldquo;Dr Son &amp; Daughter.&rdquo; In September of 1832, their first child was
born there, a son named George Washington Custis Lee, after his grandfather.
Christmas that year at Arlington was especially happy because of
the new baby (known familiarly as &ldquo;Custis&rdquo; Lee), and because Lee was
unexpectedly able to be there. The following year passed much the same
way.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE ON DUTY AT WASHINGTON, 1834 TO 1837.</span> In the autumn of 1834,
Lee was transferred to Washington and with his family made his home
at Arlington. Sometimes his work kept him away overnight, but usually
each morning and afternoon he was to be seen riding between his office
and home. Lee disliked the office work which kept him in the city until
the middle of 1837, but life at Arlington was most pleasant. Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s
parents idolized their little grandson, and for them Lee felt a growing respect
and affection. Custis was the nearest link to the first President, and
associating with him and living in the presence of so many of the General&rsquo;s
personal belongings made Washington very close and real to the
young engineer, an example and influence that steadily entered his soul.</p>
<p>Lee fitted easily into the quiet way of life at Arlington. Mrs. Lee and
her mother cared little for formal social affairs, preferring to be out of
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
doors gardening or riding about the estate when not entertaining visitors.
Mr. Custis was usually busy with his farm, and since he liked to hunt,
he might often be seen walking or riding about the estate with his gun
and dogs; evenings he spent with his family by the hearth, or retired to
his study to work on his literary efforts. Each morning and evening the
family and servants gathered for prayers, and grace was said before each
meal. On Sundays the family usually drove into Alexandria to church,
or held services at home if the roads were bad. Mrs. Lee, like her father,
was an amateur artist, an interest shared by her husband who also occasionally
assisted Mr. Custis in his business affairs or put his engineering
experience to use in making improvements.</p>
<p>Troubles there were, of course. Lee was away on a mission to Ohio
and Michigan when his second child, a daughter whom they named
Mary, was born in the summer of 1835. When he returned, he found
his wife so seriously ill that she was unable to walk for months. This
was the first of a series of illnesses which were to make her an invalid
much of her life.</p>
<p>Though this experience saddened Lee at the time, it made his home
the more dear to him. It was about this time that he wrote to a friend:
&ldquo;The Country looks very sweet now, and the hill at Arlington covered
with verdure, and perfumed by the blossoms of the trees, the flowers of
the Garden. Honey-Suckles, yellow Jasmine, &amp;c. is more to my taste
than at any other season of the year. But the brightest flower there
blooming is my daughter.... [I] hurry home to her every day.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES AT ST. LOUIS, 1838 TO 1839.</span> In 1837 another son was born,
and although Lee had received orders to report to St. Louis he was able
to remain at Arlington until he was assured the mother and baby were
doing well. Christmas he was home again, remaining there till spring
so Mrs. Lee and the two boys could return with him to St. Louis. Little
Mary stayed behind with her grandparents, which may have compensated
them somewhat for the absence of her parents the following Christmas.</p>
<p>Now a captain, Lee brought his family home in the spring of 1839
for Mrs. Lee to await the arrival of their fourth child, though he could
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
not remain for the event. Early in July, he heard a new daughter had
joined the family circle, but not until Christmas did he get to see her.</p>
<p>An incident which probably occurred that winter illustrates the seriousness
with which Lee viewed his family responsibilities. He and 8-year-old
Custis had gone for a walk one snowy day, the boy following behind
while his father broke the way. Preoccupied with ploughing through the
deep snow, the father failed to look behind for some time, and when he
did, saw that his little son was setting his feet carefully in the tracks his
father had made, while imitating his every movement. &ldquo;When I saw
this,&rdquo; Lee related afterwards, &ldquo;I said to myself, &lsquo;It behooves me to walk
very straight, when the little fellow is already following in my tracks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE AT FORT HAMILTON, N. Y., 1841 TO 1846.</span> Lee did not return to
St. Louis until the summer of 1840, and then only to finish up his work
and return home. There his fifth child, a girl, was born the following
February. Soon after, Lee was sent to Fort Hamilton, N. Y., where he
remained on duty until 1846. During these years it was customary for
his family to be with him at New York during the summer and fall
months and at Arlington the rest of the year, where Lee usually passed
the winter. Two more children, a boy and a girl, were born in these years.
Telling a friend about the arrival of the boy, Lee wrote: &ldquo;About a month
ago a young Robert E. Lee made his appearance at Arlington, much to
the surprise and admiration of his brothers and sisters. He has a fine
long nose like his father, but no whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">WAR WITH MEXICO, 1846 TO 1848.</span> Because war with Mexico seemed
imminent when Lee went back to Fort Hamilton in the spring of 1846,
Mrs. Lee and the children remained at Arlington. Hostilities began in
May, and in August Lee was ordered to report for service in Mexico.
Returning home, he spent a few days at Arlington arranging his affairs,
then said goodbye to his family. Twenty-two months passed before he
saw it again, months of anxiety for those waiting at home, relieved only
by his long and frequent letters, such as the one he wrote to his two
eldest sons the day before Christmas, 1846: &ldquo;I hope good Santa Claus
will fill my Rob&rsquo;s stocking to-night: that Mildred&rsquo;s, Agnes&rsquo;s, and Anna&rsquo;s
may break down with good things. I do not know what he may have
for you and Mary, but if he only leaves for you one half of what I wish,
you will want for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The war ended early in 1848, and seeing many of the returning volunteers
enjoy Mr. Custis&rsquo; hospitality at Arlington Spring must have made
the Lees more impatient for the return of their own hero. When Lee
finally arrived in Washington he missed the carriage sent for him, and
so procured a horse to ride home. None of those anxiously watching for
a glimpse of the carriage noticed the lone horseman ascending the hill,
and not till &ldquo;Spec,&rdquo; Lee&rsquo;s dog, rushed out joyfully barking did they
realize their soldier was home. Great was the excitement as he greeted
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
them in the hall, and his mistaking a friend&rsquo;s little boy for his own added
to the hilarity. &ldquo;Here I am again, my dear Smith,&rdquo; Lee wrote to his
brother the next day, &ldquo;perfectly surrounded by Mary and her precious
children, who seem to devote themselves to staring at the furrows in my
face and the white hairs in my head.... I find them too much grown,
and all well, and I have much cause for thankfulness and gratitude to
that good God who has once more united us.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES AT ARLINGTON, 1848 TO 1849.</span> The summer of 1848 was a
happy one at Arlington, for Lee was on duty in Washington and was
promoted to brevet colonel, so that hereafter he would be titled &ldquo;Colonel
Lee.&rdquo; Toward the end of the year he was assigned to supervise the construction
of a new fort in Baltimore, but soon after officially taking over
the project, he returned to Arlington. This was the winter that a guest
at Arlington observed Lee&rsquo;s face in quiet repose as he read to his family
assembled about the table one night, and thought to herself: &ldquo;You
certainly look more like a great man than any one I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee and her mother made an equally favorable impression on a
lady who visited Arlington the next spring. &ldquo;We had tea in the Washington
teacups, and Mrs. Lee took me into the tangled neglected gardens,
full of rose-buds, and allowed me to pick my fill of the sweet dainty Bon
Silene variety, which she told me blossomed all winter. What a view
that was!... Mrs. Lee had the face of a genius: a wealth of dark hair,
carelessly put up, gave her fine head the air of one of Romney&rsquo;s portraits.
She was most lovely and sympathetic. Her mother, Mrs. Custis, was a
woman full of character.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES AT BALTIMORE, 1849 TO 1852.</span> Lee was home for a short time
during the summer of 1849 to recuperate from a touch of fever, and in
the autumn his family joined him at Baltimore. There they lived through
1851, coming home for Christmas and occasional visits. Seldom was the
family together, however, for their eldest son, Custis, entered West Point
in 1850, and usually some of the children were at Arlington with their
grandparents.</p>
<p>Mrs. Custis kept the absent ones informed as to what was going on at
Arlington. &ldquo;Your Grandfather is seized with a spirit of improvement
lately,&rdquo; she wrote to the lad at West Point in 1851. &ldquo;He is making new
steps to the Portico (the old ones having so decayed as to be unsafe) and
intends paving it with octagon brick tiles which are now being burned
in the vast brick kilns in Washington.&rdquo; Later, she reported that the steps
were finished and the portico floor about to be laid.</p>
<p>Though 70 and often unwell, Mr. Custis&rsquo; activity seldom flagged. A
polished and effective speaker, with a gift for being able to enter into
the spirit of an occasion, he was well-liked for his personal charm and
unassuming manner. He was fond of children, and a great favorite with
the young Lees. Conscious of his advancing years, Custis increased the
output of his <i>Recollections of Washington</i>, that his personal knowledge of
the General might not be lost. In this he was encouraged by the Lees,
who also approved his renewed interest in scientific agriculture. While
strongly advocating the establishment of a department of agriculture in
the National Government, Custis applied the latest methods of fertilizing
and cultivation to his own farms so that the land inherited by his
grandchildren would be fertile, rather than worn-out like that of so much
of his native State.</p>

<p>Christmas in 1851 was typical of the many happy ones celebrated at
Arlington, and, telling his son at West Point about it, Lee wrote: &ldquo;[We]
found your grandfather at the Washington depot, Daniel and the old
carriage and horses, and young Daniel on the colt Mildred. Your mother,
grandfather, Mary Eliza, the little people, and the baggage, I thought
load enough for the carriage, so Rooney and I took our feet in our hands
and walked over.... The snow impeded the carriage as well as us, and
we reached here shortly after it. The children were delighted at getting
back, and passed the evening in devising pleasure for the morrow. They
were in upon us before day on Christmas morning, to overhaul their
stockings.... I need not describe to you our amusements, you have
witnessed them so often; nor the turkey, cold ham, plum-pudding, mince
pies, etc., at dinner.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rooney&rdquo; was the Lee&rsquo;s second boy, William Henry
Fitzhugh.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES AT WEST POINT, 1852 TO 1855; DEATH OF MRS. CUSTIS.</span> Lee
took command of West Point in September 1852, where he was shortly
joined by his family. Mrs. Custis had been well when they left, so the
telegram which came in April telling of her critical illness was entirely
unexpected. Mrs. Lee started for home at once, but on arrival found her
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
beloved mother dead and her father prostrated by his loss. She at once
took charge of the household and herself conducted the morning worship
which had been forgotten in the sorrow and confusion. After breakfast
she selected a spot for her mother&rsquo;s grave among the trees a short distance
from the house. For years, Lee had called Mrs. Custis &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;
and his grief at her death was almost as great as Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s. By now the
religious convictions instilled in him by his mother had been matured
by his own experiences and the example of those at Arlington, and
soon after his return from West Point at the end of the term, he and two
of his daughters were confirmed at Christ Church, Alexandria.</p>
<p>Hoping to divert Mr. Custis, the Lees took him back with them to
West Point. But not even a trip to Niagara Falls with his son-in-law
could keep him from worrying about his beloved Arlington, and he soon
returned home. To ease his loneliness, the Lees came home on brief visits
in the spring and summer of 1854.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE IN TEXAS, 1855 TO 1857.</span> Early in 1855, Lee was assigned to a cavalry
regiment being organized for service on the frontier. Before leaving for
his new station he made arrangements to have the large unfinished
room off the main hall, at Arlington, made into a drawing room and to
have a hot-air furnace installed to heat the house. The &ldquo;Big Room,&rdquo; as
it was called, when finished was very handsome with its marble mantelpieces
and crystal chandelier, and Mrs. Lee and the girls were proud of
its appearance when they showed it to Lee on his return for the holidays.</p>
<p>Much of his leave was given over to straightening out the finances of
Mr. Custis&rsquo; other farms, for the old gentleman was now 75 and, though
active in improving his lands and crops, needed the assistance of his
son-in-law in managing his business affairs. Lee returned to Texas in
February 1856, and was unable to be home for Christmas that year. His
loneliness is apparent in the letter he wrote to Mrs. Lee: &ldquo;The time is
approaching when I trust many of you will be assembled around the
family hearth at dear Arlington, to celebrate another Christmas. Though
absent, my heart will be in the midst of you, &amp; I shall enjoy in imagination
&amp; memory, all that is going on. May nothing occur to mar or cloud
the family fireside, &amp; may each be able to look back with pride &amp;
pleasure at their deeds of the past year, &amp; with confidence &amp; hope to that
in prospect. I can do nothing but hope &amp; pray for you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">DEATH OF MR. CUSTIS.</span> Life at Arlington and for the father far away in
Texas flowed on quietly during 1857. Although badly crippled by rheumatism,
Mrs. Lee was able to manage the household and spend much
time in her garden, while her father occupied himself as usual. But in
the fall a telegram came to Lee, telling him of Mr. Custis&rsquo; death on
October 10th. Letters from the family told him more of the sad event:
how Mr. Custis had been ill of pneumonia only 4 days, how he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
steadily failed, and how on the last day, after embracing his weeping
daughter and grandchildren and asking to be remembered to his son-in-law,
had passed away while his rector said the prayers for the dying. His
last wish had been to be buried by the side of his wife, and to that spot
his coffin had been borne by the family servants, followed by the Lees
and a host of relatives and friends.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE BECOMES MASTER OF ARLINGTON.</span> It was a saddened household to
which Lee returned as soon as he could, made more so because Mrs.
Lee&rsquo;s illness had progressed to where she was almost incapable of getting
about the house. He found it necessary to take an extended leave in
order to take on the management of Mr. Custis&rsquo; properties and, as his
executor, to carry out the terms of his will. This provided that after outstanding
debts had been paid and legacies given each of the Lee girls,
the farms were to go to the boys, although Mrs. Lee would have possession
of Arlington until her death, after which it would pass to Custis
Lee. All the slaves were to be freed within 5 years.</p>
<p>A large debt had to be paid off before anything else could be done,
and Lee applied himself to making the farms as productive as possible
by putting more land under cultivation and planting larger crops. For a
time, it seemed that it would be impossible for him ever to discharge
his obligations satisfactorily, but he could still hide his discouragement
from his children, as when in the autumn of 1858 he came upon one of
his daughters saying a tearful goodbye to a friend, and said cheerfully to
the weeping girls: &ldquo;No tears at Arlington, no tears.&rdquo; Fortunately, by the
summer of 1859 he could see some improvement in the situation,
although much remained to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">JOHN BROWN&rsquo;S RAID AND THE IMPENDING CRISIS.</span> One morning in
October 1859, a young lieutenant, J. E. B. Stuart, who had been a guest
at Arlington several times, came with orders for Lee to report at once to
the Secretary of War. There he learned of John Brown&rsquo;s raid on Harpers
Ferry and was directed to take command of the forces being sent to quell
the uprising. This was soon accomplished, and in a short while Lee was
home again.</p>
<p>Affairs at Arlington were so encouraging that autumn, that Lee expected
soon to rejoin his regiment in Texas. Therefore, he arranged to
have his son, Custis, who was now in the Corps of Engineers, transferred
to Washington where he could supervise the estate. Unlike many army
officers, Lee had never been away long from his native State, and his
months of hard work at Arlington had given him a sympathetic understanding
of the problems faced by his kinsmen and fellow-planters and
reaffirmed his belief that his first loyalty was to Virginia.</p>
<p>These were his views when he went to Texas in February 1860, and
they remained unchanged as the discord between the North and South
grew more intense. Uneasily, he observed the recklessness of the extremists
on both sides, hoping always that the Union he loved would
be preserved. Texas seceded in February 1861, and Lee, who had been
ordered to report to Washington, arrived home at Arlington a month
later. &ldquo;I met Col. Robert E. Lee at Gen. Scott&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; one of his army
friends wrote in his diary, March 5th. &ldquo;He feels badly at the prospect.&rdquo;
Probably all that Lee could tell his old friend was that if Virginia seceded
he must follow her, and that all he could do was to await developments.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE RESIGNS FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMY.</span> While Lee watched,
helpless, events moved rapidly. Fort Sumter was bombarded in April,
and in a few days Lee heard that his own beloved Virginia had seceded.
Great as was his pride in the Union, he did not believe that it should be
preserved by force; moreover, he felt his first allegiance was to his State.
Though his career be sacrificed and the lives and property of his children
endangered, he believed he must do his duty as he saw it.</p>
<p>Arlington blazed with lights Friday night, April 19,1861, and was
filled with relations and friends anxiously discussing the recent events.
Finding it impossible to think about his problem amid the excitement,
Colonel Lee went outside and paced back and forth under the trees
while he pondered his future course. Still undecided, he returned to the
house and went up to his bedroom. Downstairs, Mrs. Lee and the others
waited anxiously. Overhead, they could hear Lee&rsquo;s footsteps as he paced
the floor, stopping only when he knelt to pray. It was after midnight
when he finally arrived at a decision and sat down to write his resignation
from the United States Army. That done, he came down with it in
his hand to where his wife was waiting. &ldquo;Well, Mary,&rdquo; he said quietly,
&ldquo;the question is settled. Here is my letter of resignation, and a letter I
have written to General Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEES LEAVE ARLINGTON.</span> Monday morning, Lee said goodbye to
his family and left for Richmond. Before him were the long, hard years
of a bitter war from which he would gain unfading glory. But never
again would he be sheltered by the friendly roof of his old home at
Arlington, and only once would he have a glimpse of it, and then
from a passing train, several years after the war.</p>

<p>In view of the strategic location of Arlington, Lee urged his wife to
go to a place of safety, but no preparations had been made to leave when
word reached Mrs. Lee, early in May, that the Federal forces were soon
to move into Virginia. Then all was excitement as the family portraits
were taken from their frames and, with the plate and the most valuable
Washington relics, sent off for safekeeping. Curtains and carpets were
packed away in the attic, books and engravings put in closets, and the
china stored in boxes in the cellar. Most of the furniture had to be left
behind, but this Mrs. Lee trusted she could recover later. When everything
was in order, it was time to say farewell to the weeping servants,
and to leave her home for what was to be the last time.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">ARLINGTON OCCUPIED BY THE FEDERAL ARMY.</span> Mrs. Lee had been gone
only a few days when the Federal Army crossed the river and occupied
the heights opposite the National Capital. Overnight, what had been
a quiet country estate was transformed into a vast military encampment.
New roads were cut through the woods and much of it felled to open
fields of fire for the earthen forts being built a short distance west of the
house. Guards were posted to protect the house, and when the commanding
general learned that many articles nevertheless were being
stolen, he sent the Washington relics, which had been stored in the
cellar, to the Patent Office for safekeeping, and then established his
headquarters inside the mansion. Inevitably, the estate suffered greatly,
though strong efforts were made to prevent wanton destruction, particularly
of the fine old trees.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE BECOMES THE HERO OF THE SOUTH.</span> While Arlington was blighted
by grim war, its former master was engaged in mobilizing the defenses
of his native State. Before long he was military adviser to the President
of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, and successively commander of the
Army of Northern Virginia and general in chief of all the Confederate
armies. The qualities developed by his years in the army and his home
life were the same that now made him the military champion of the
South and its greatest hero. His self-discipline rarely deserted him,
and his deep religious beliefs gave him a humility and simplicity sufficient
to withstand the greatest discouragements. Even though the odds
were against him, his splendid presence on the field of battle and his
kindliness and courtesy to all regardless of rank won him the devotion
of his officers and men, while his brilliant military leadership gave hope
and fighting spirit to the entire South. Always he was the knightly
Christian gentleman, humane and magnanimous whether in victory or
defeat.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE NATIONAL CEMETERY ESTABLISHED AT ARLINGTON, 1864.</span> Early in
1862, the army moved away from Arlington for service in the field, but
the mansion continued to be used as a headquarters. In 1864, the
Government levied a tax on the Arlington estate. Because Mrs. Lee
was unable to appear personally to pay the tax as stipulated, payment
through her agent was refused and the property sold at public auction.
In June of that year the first burials were made in 200 acres set aside
as a national cemetery. Work was begun at once to restore the former
natural beauty of the grounds, and by the end of the war almost all
the scars caused by its military occupation had been erased. Only the
long rows of white headboards gleaming among the trees and the desolate
house now used only for the cemetery office bespoke the bitter
strife that had wrought such a profound change at Arlington.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small"><i>Arlington from 1865 to the Present</i></span></h2>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">LEE&rsquo;S INFLUENCE HELPS TO RESTORE THE SOUTH AFTER THE WAR.</span> The
splendid leadership which Lee had given his people during the war did
not cease at Appomattox. As president of Washington College (afterwards
Washington and Lee University), he devoted himself to restoring
the South culturally, economically, and politically. Magnanimous in
peace as in war, he urged his countrymen to forswear hatred and make
the best of their situation. By his advice and example he did much to
bring about the true restoration of the Union, not by force, but by the
immeasurably stronger bonds of reconciliation and a common loyalty.</p>
<p>For a time General Lee hoped to regain possession of Arlington for
his wife, but he died in 1870 without having recovered it. Mrs. Lee died
3 years later, and her son Custis then took legal action to obtain his inheritance.
In 1882, the case was finally decided in his favor by the
Supreme Court of the United States, but since thousands of soldiers had
been buried at Arlington, Custis Lee accepted the offer of the Government
to buy the property for $150,000.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">ARLINGTON BECOMES FAMOUS AS THE FORMER HOME OF GENERAL LEE.</span>
Originally &ldquo;Arlington House&rdquo; had been famous for its associations with
George Washington; but after the Civil War it became even more widely
known as the former home of General Lee. Though its rooms were
empty, thousands from all over the country came to see it each year
because of the universal admiration for its former master. It was in response
to this sentiment that Representative Louis C. Cramton, of
Michigan, sponsored the legislation passed by Congress in 1925 which
authorized the restoration of the mansion as a national memorial.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">RESTORATION OF THE MANSION.</span> The project of restoring and refurnishing
the mansion was begun by the War Department in 1928.
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Structural changes made since 1861 were removed and the house refurnished
as nearly as possible as when occupied by the Lee and Custis
families. The original furnishings having long since been scattered or
lost, few could be returned to their old setting, but copies were made of
furniture and portraits known to have been at Arlington and pieces
appropriate to the period procured. By 1933, when the mansion was
transferred to the National Park Service of the Department of the
Interior, the major portion of the work had been finished. However,
the work of restoring the mansion to its original condition is a continuing
process, as structural changes based on historical research are
made and more of the original furnishings are identified and acquired.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small"><i>Guide to the House and Grounds</i></span></h2>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE OLD ARLINGTON ESTATE.</span> Arlington was but one of several estates
totaling more than 15,000 acres owned by George Washington Parke
Custis, father-in-law of General Lee. Since the former&rsquo;s income was
largely derived from two large farms on the Pamunkey River in New
Kent County, Va., he kept Arlington mainly as a gentleman&rsquo;s country
estate after the English fashion. The greater part of Arlington was taken
up by &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; a virgin woodland of ancient oaks and beautiful groves
of walnut, chestnut, and elm trees, extending from the Georgetown and
Alexandria Road at the foot of the hill clear to the western edge of the
estate.</p>
<p>On the level land lying between the road and Potomac River was
&ldquo;the Farm,&rdquo; consisting of an orchard and several large cultivated fields
and pastures. Here was grown most of the grain and vegetables required
by the Arlington household and the large number of slaves, the surplus
being sold in the Washington markets. In the southeast corner of the
farm was the Arlington landing, where the barge which hauled produce
to market was kept, as well as the schooner <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, used to
carry goods to and from the distant farms. Here also docked the steamboats
<i>Arlington Belle</i> and the <i>G. W. P. Custis</i>, which annually ferried
thousands from the city to the famed Arlington Spring, for half a century
a favorite picnic spot for Georgetown and Washington residents. For
their convenience the hospitable owner erected pavilions for dining and
dancing, requiring only that no liquor be used. Custis considered himself
primarily a farmer, and spent most of each day riding or walking about
the estate supervising the work being done. After he died in 1857 and
the management of the estate was taken over by Col. Robert E. Lee, the
area under cultivation was considerably enlarged.</p>
<p>Arlington originally had been part of a tract of 6,000 acres granted in
1669 by Governor William Berkeley of Virginia to a ship&rsquo;s captain,
named Robert Howsing, in payment for transporting settlers to the
colony. Howsing soon sold his grant to John Alexander, after whom
Alexandria, Va., is named, reportedly for six hogsheads of tobacco. The
land remained in the Alexander family until 1778, when John Parke
Custis bought 1,100 acres from Gerard Alexander with the intention of
establishing a family seat. He died, however, before he had done anything
with the property, whereupon it passed to his son, George
Washington Parke Custis, who developed it as described.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE MANSION.</span> For all its imposing appearance when seen at a distance,
the real size of the mansion is not apparent until seen close at
hand. The central part of the building is 2 stories high, 60 feet wide, and
40 feet deep. One-story wings, each 40 feet long and 25 feet wide, extend
to the north and south, making the length of the entire building 140
feet. In the rear are still lower wings for service and a conservatory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="505" />
<p class="pcap"><i>&ldquo;Arlington House&rdquo; from a sketch made before 1861, though not
published until 1875.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although the wings with their tall recessed windows and balustrade
are quite pleasing, the magnificent portico is the salient architectural
feature of the mansion, one of the earliest and best-known examples of
Greek Doric porticos in America. This extends 25 feet from the front
of the house and has 8 columns 23 feet high and somewhat over 5 feet
thick at the base. Early authorities differ as to whether the portico was
derived from the smaller, well-proportioned Greek temple at Athens
known as the Theseum, or the larger, more imposing temple of Neptune
at Paestum, Italy. There is no doubt, however, as to the effectiveness of
the architectural style chosen, for no other would have had the strength
and massiveness necessary to make the building impressive when viewed
from across the river. Yet for all its simplicity and solidity, the proportions
of the mansion are so refined as to make it an outstanding example
of Greek Classic Revival architecture of the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The building is of the most solid construction throughout. All the
walls and most of the foundations are of brick, as are the columns of
the portico. All of the brickwork exposed to the weather is protected by
hard stucco plaster scored with lines in imitation of cut stone. Joists,
studs, and rafters are of hewn timber and are neatly mortised together
or pinned with wooden pegs, scarcely any nails being used. Doors,
cornices, and other woodwork are of pine. The main roof is supported
by great barnlike trusses which span the entire width of the center section
and originally was covered with wooden shingles, now replaced by
slate. At one time the portico columns were painted to look like marble,
but later were made white for better contrast with the warm buff or
ochre color of the remainder of the house. Well constructed to begin
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
with, the deterioration inevitable in any old building was entirely corrected
when the War Department restored the building. Careful maintenance
now assures a long and useful future for the Custis-Lee Mansion.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE CONSERVATORY.</span> Because flowers were important in the life of the
Arlington household, it is most appropriate that present-day visitors
enter the mansion through the conservatory. Both Mrs. Lee and her
mother, Mrs. Custis, were devoted to their gardens and used flowers for
decorations throughout the house. Called the &ldquo;conservatory,&rdquo; or &ldquo;greenhouse,&rdquo;
and sometimes the &ldquo;camellia house,&rdquo; by those who lived there,
this was the room in which they grew their favorite flowers and plants
during the winter months or started young ones for transplanting outdoors.
The floor of the conservatory has been restored, but the woodwork
and most of the windows are original.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">

<p class="pcap"><i>The conservatory.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE OFFICE AND STUDY.</span> The management of a large estate like Arlington
required an office where business could be transacted and records
kept, and this long, narrow room was used as such by both Mr. Custis
and Colonel Lee. Here the former worked on his literary efforts and carried
on an extensive correspondence concerning agricultural matters and
the life of General Washington. In his old age Mr. Custis also used it as
his &ldquo;painting room,&rdquo; for in 1852 he wrote to a fellow artist: &ldquo;I have an
excellent studio fitted up in the South wing of the House, with a first
rate light, ... a stove &amp; everything comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The office and study.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The desk in the corner was used by Lee during the years 1848 to 1852,
while supervising the construction of Fort Carroll, near Baltimore, Md.
Also of interest is his traveling chess set and the plain pine stand which
Mrs. Lee gave to her personal maid, Selina Gray, whose descendants
returned it to the house.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE DINING ROOM.</span> &ldquo;The House will be a very showy handsome building
when completed,&rdquo; wrote a lady visiting Arlington in 1804. &ldquo;The
room we were in was 24 feet square &amp; 18 feet high,&rdquo; she continued. No
doubt she was describing the present dining room, for here the Custises
entertained their numerous guests before the large central section of the
house was built. Later, Mr. Custis used it as a studio, and after his wife&rsquo;s
death, in 1853, it became Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;morning room,&rdquo; where she answered
her mail and managed the affairs of her household. Here Mrs.
Lee was engaged in copying a portrait of her infant grandson when, in
May 1861, she was informed that the Federal Army was soon to occupy
Arlington and that she must leave at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The dining room has been restored to its earliest use. Most of the
woodwork and windows are original, while the molding, plaster, and
the beautiful door to the study are entirely so. An interesting architectural
feature is the great semicircular arch at the north end of the
room, reminiscent of the villas Architect George Hadfield saw in Italy
during the years he studied there.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE DRAWING ROOM.</span> The drawing room remained unfinished for many
years, not even being plastered, probably because Mr. Custis lacked the
necessary funds. During these years it was known as the &ldquo;big room&rdquo;
and in it were stored old furniture and the finished canvasses of Mr.
Custis. On rainy days the Lee children often used it as a playroom. When
Colonel Lee went to Texas, in 1855, he left instructions for its &ldquo;renovation&rdquo;&mdash;plastering
the walls, installing a crystal chandelier, and painting
the walls and woodwork. He also ordered marble mantels for the fireplaces.
Mrs. Lee supervised the progress of the work in her husband&rsquo;s
absence, and the result must have been most pleasing, for a young lady
who saw it in 1856 describes it as &ldquo;a beautiful &amp; noble drawing room,
very handsomely furnished and hung too with paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p18a.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The dining room.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The most valuable paintings were taken away by Mrs. Lee in 1861,
but copies have been made for the restoration of this room. The sofa is
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
original, as is the music cabinet near the piano. The woodwork and
walls are finished off as Colonel Lee had them done in 1855.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE HALL.</span> A long hall extending from the front to the back was a
common feature of Virginia houses of the period, because of the cooling
draft of air it provided during hot weather. For this reason it was usually
furnished with sofas and chairs and used as a summer parlor. The Lees
and Custises would sit and converse here on warm summer evenings, or
perhaps read the latest English novel aloud to each other. &ldquo;The puss has
appropriated the sofa in the parlor to himself, while I occupy that in
the hall,&rdquo; Mr. Custis observed humorously in a letter to his wife in 1831.</p>
<p>Characteristic of the Greek temples from which the mansion was
adapted are the tall narrow doors at each end of the hall. The graceful
round arches at the west end are typical of George Hadfield&rsquo;s architectural
work. High on the walls at this end are the spirited hunting
frescoes painted by Mr. Custis himself. Elk and deer horns represent the
collection of antlers begun by him when a lad at Mount Vernon.
Suspended from the ceiling in the middle of the hall is a replica of the
famous Mount Vernon lantern, the original of which hung here for more
than 50 years. On the walls are copies of portraits once at Arlington,
including one of George Washington painted by Mr. Custis.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE FAMILY PARLOR.</span> From an early date three arches have divided the
large room north of the hall into a family parlor and a small dining
room. Originally, there were doors and a fanlight in the center arch,
while those on the outside were filled in with lath and plaster, probably
to make the rooms easier to heat. The twin Carrara marble mantels are
original, and are said to have been ordered by Mr. Custis from Italy.</p>
<p>The family parlor was the favorite gathering place of the Lees and
Custises, who entertained most of their guests in it even after the drawing
room was completed. Here the family passed the winter evenings
reading or listening to Mr. Custis&rsquo; interesting stories of his boyhood at
Mount Vernon. Each Christmas it was the family custom to kindle the
great yule log in the fireplace with the remains of that from the previous
year. The wedding of Mary Custis and Robert E. Lee took place in this
room.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The family parlor.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE FAMILY DINING ROOM.</span> Small and informal, the family dining room
was used as such from the time the center section of the house was built
until the Lees departed in 1861. Arlington was noted for its hospitality,
and seldom was there a meal at which some guests were not present.
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
When he was at home, it was Colonel Lee&rsquo;s custom to gather rosebuds
in the garden each morning and place one beside the plate of each of his
daughters, the youngest getting the smallest bud, and so on up to the
eldest.</p>
<p>Over the mantel hangs a portrait of Mr. Custis, copied from the
original in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C. On the
mantel is a statuette, &ldquo;The Three Graces,&rdquo; said to have been imported
from Italy by Mr. Custis about 1855. Among the dishes in the cupboard
are two custard cups, a Wedgewood cream pitcher, and several other
pieces which were originally at Arlington.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE UPPER HALL.</span> The simple staircase which ascends to the upper hall
is typical of those in houses of classic revival style of architecture, since
their temple prototypes had no second floor and hence no stairs. That
the one in the mansion was carefully planned by the architect, however,
is shown by the ingenious way in which one window serves to light
the stair landing and the closet off it, as well as the hall below.</p>
<p>Like the one below, the upper hall was originally furnished with several
long sofas for use as a sitting room during warm weather. At such
times the lower part of the great window at the west end was opened
wide in order to increase the movement of air.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEE BEDROOM.</span> This pleasant room was occupied by Mrs. Lee before
and after her marriage. According to tradition, six of her seven children
were born in the small dressing room on its west side. Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s toilet
and serving case, resembling a miniature lectern and bearing her initials
&ldquo;M. C. L.,&rdquo; sits on the bureau next to the door of the dressing room. On
the mantel is an engraving of Mrs. Lee made at Arlington in 1858. This
is believed to be the room in which Colonel Lee arrived at his decision
to resign his commission in the United States Army.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE BOYS&rsquo; BEDROOM.</span> This bedroom was occupied by the three Lee
sons&mdash;Custis, Robert, and William Henry Fitzhugh, otherwise known
as &ldquo;Rooney.&rdquo; The floor, mantel, woodwork, and plaster cornice in this
room are original. The mahogany washstand was at Arlington prior to
1861.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The bedroom of Colonel
and Mrs. Lee.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Next to the boys&rsquo; room is a small chamber originally divided by a
partition into dressing rooms for the adjoining bedrooms. In 1857, Mrs.
Lee had the partition removed and a doorway made into the hall in order
to provide more space for guests. Since the room was too small for a bed,
a cot was set up whenever additional sleeping quarters were needed. The
washstand and the Duncan Phyfe side chair are original Arlington pieces.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">ROOM OF MARY LEE AND &ldquo;MARKIE.&rdquo;</span> Mary Lee, eldest of the Lee
daughters, occupied this room from her earliest days. Occasionally, she
shared it with one of her sisters, but more often with Martha Williams,
known affectionately as &ldquo;Markie,&rdquo; a cousin of both Colonel and Mrs.
Lee. Markie&rsquo;s mother died in 1843, and her father was killed 3 years
later during the war with Mexico. Although Markie lived with her
grandparents in Georgetown, she was at Arlington so much of the time
as to be almost a member of the household, leading another guest to
observe, in 1856, that &ldquo;Markie&rsquo;s room commands a beautiful view of the
river &amp; of Washington.&rdquo; Markie and her father were both talented
artists and several of their paintings embellished the house.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Miss Mary Lee&rsquo;s room.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE LEE GIRLS&rsquo; BEDROOM.</span> This large, sunny bedroom was occupied by
Agnes, Annie, and Mildred Lee. Although it is not one of the original
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Arlington furnishings, the miniature mahogany bureau on the table
against the west wall is noteworthy as having been owned by Anne Hill
Carter Lee, mother of Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE PLAYROOM.</span> The small room next to the girls&rsquo; bedroom served
various purposes. When the girls were young it was their playroom.
Later it was probably a dressing room, as indicated by the original shelves
and coat pegs. It was also used by Annie Lee for the Sunday school she
conducted for the children of the family servants. According to tradition,
the miniature secretary at the back of the room was a childhood possession
of Mr. Custis&rsquo; sister, Nellie, who gave it to Mrs. Lee when she was
little. Later it was given by Lee to his goddaughter, Nannie Randolph
Heth.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE OUTER HALL.</span> Visitors return to the first floor by the steep service
stairway, intended primarily for the convenience of members of the
family and servants. Like the second floor hall, the stairwell is painted
as it was originally&mdash;a light peach. Beyond is the outer hall, originally
the serving pantry for the nearby dining room. Here in its old location
stands the walnut cupboard to which each night at bedtime Colonel Lee
is said to have come for a glass of milk, brought there from the dairy
room under the south wing.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE CUSTIS ROOMS.</span> An inner hall gave private access to the two small
rooms in the north wing occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Custis in the years
before the main part of the house was completed. Later they were probably
used for guest rooms until such time as the size of the Lee family
and the Custises&rsquo; advancing years made it advisable for them to reoccupy
their old suite. In the larger room is the bed Custis bought about 1805;
in the smaller room, under the window, is a small mahogany candle
stand once owned by Martha Washington and later part of the Arlington
furnishings.</p>
<p>The wooden mantelpiece in the sitting room is the oldest one in the
house, and its disproportionate size indicates that it was made for the
large unused chimney breast in the inner hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>

<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="788" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The wooden mantelpiece in the Custis bedroom is the oldest
in the house, dating from its earliest years.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE SCHOOLROOM.</span> This may have been Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s bedroom when she
was a little girl and her parents occupied the adjoining rooms. After the
main part of the house was built, it was used as a sewing room and a
schoolroom for the Lee children and those of the house servants. The
old terrestrial globe is one of the most interesting original objects in the
mansion, having been found tucked away in the attic under the eaves by
workmen repairing the roof some years ago. The small pine table on
which it stands is also an original piece. Over the globe is a framed
photograph of Comdr. Sidney Smith Lee, brother of Robert E. Lee. The
walls and woodwork, like those of most of the rooms, have been restored
to their original color.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The winter kitchen.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE WINTER KITCHEN.</span> The huge fireplace in the winter kitchen under
the north wing helped to warm the rooms above during the cold months
of the year. The portion of the room beyond the chimney was used as
a laundry.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE WINE CELLAR.</span> A quarterly return from one of Mr. Custis&rsquo; estates,
dated 1822, lists &ldquo;2 hogsheads of cider, 2 barrels of A[pple] Brandy&rdquo; as
having been sent to Arlington. It was probably stored in this cool, dark
room, together with the scuppernong wine made from grapes grown
along the edge of the garden north of the mansion. Here also were kept
the choicer vintages used for entertaining.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE SERVANTS&rsquo; QUARTERS.</span> Two low buildings which harmonize architecturally
with the main house form two sides of the court in the rear
of the mansion. That on the north had a summer kitchen in the basement,
its other rooms being occupied by the family servants. Perhaps
because dampness made it unhealthy, the basement was filled in some
years before 1861, but it is now restored to its original condition. The
well between this building and the house is original, though the stone
coping and roof are a restoration.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="399" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The north servants&rsquo; quarters and the well.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The corresponding building to the south was familiarly known as
&ldquo;Selina&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; because its western end was occupied by Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s
personal maid, Selina Gray, and her family. The middle room was the
smokehouse, and on the east end was the storeroom where nonperishable
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
household provisions were kept. The small panels over the doors were
originally painted by Mr. Custis, the one in the center depicting General
Washington&rsquo;s war horse and the others, American eagles. Old
photographs show similar panels decorating the north quarters, but
these have long since weathered away.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p24a.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Custis-Lee Mansion as seen from the west.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE GARDENS.</span> The flower garden originally occupied the large level
plot south of the mansion. Gravel paths divided the area into flower
beds, and in the center stood a wooden arbor almost covered with yellow
jasmine and honeysuckle. Mr. Custis had laid out the garden in his early
years, but the responsibility for its care was soon assumed by Mrs. Custis,
who loved flowers. Mrs. Lee acquired her mother&rsquo;s interest in gardening
and had her own flower beds, while each of her daughters, as soon as
they were old enough, were given small plots in which to grow their
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
favorite blooms. Roses of different species predominated, the Cherokee
being a favorite of Mrs. Custis&rsquo;, but there were also many other kinds of
flowers and plants. It was the family custom to exchange seeds and
plants with friends and relatives, thus adding to the variety of lovely
blooms at Arlington.</p>
<p>North of the mansion, on the site of the present rose garden, was the
&ldquo;kitchen garden&rdquo; where the vegetables used by the household were
grown. Here were strawberry and asparagus beds, tomato vines and
many other vegetables, as well as a number of fruit trees. The gardens
were very important to the Lees, and in June of 1860 Robert E. Lee
wrote to his daughter Annie, saying, &ldquo;I was very glad to receive, my
Sweet Annie, your letter ... to hear that the garden, trees, and hill at
Arlington looked beautiful....&rdquo; The building at the north end is not
an original structure, though it stands on the site of an earlier
outbuilding.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE GRAVE OF MARY RANDOLPH.</span> The grave of Mary Randolph, believed
to have been Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s godmother, is a short distance from the northeast
corner of the mansion, down the Custis walk which here approximates
the course of the old carriage driveway. Mrs. Randolph was
related to both the Custises and the Lees and was well known in the
early part of the nineteenth century as the author of an extremely
popular cookbook, <i>The Virginia Housewife</i>. She and her husband, David
Meade Randolph, were often at Arlington, the latter being the inventor
of a special waterproof stucco used on part of the exterior of the mansion.
Mrs. Randolph died in 1828 and was the first person buried at Arlington.
The ivy growing on the brick enclosure about her tomb is said to have
been planted by Mr. and Mrs. Custis.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="small">THE CUSTIS GRAVES.</span> A few hundred yards southwest of the mansion,
Doubleday Walk passes a small plot enclosed by an iron fence. Here
beneath the beautiful trees in the spot selected by Mrs. Lee are the graves
of her mother and father. Colonel Lee ordered the marble monuments
from New York, specifying that a wreath of lilies of the valley and
heartsease should be carved on the one for Mrs. Custis&rsquo; grave. He also
supervised their erection.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small"><i>Visitor Service and Facilities</i></span></h2>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
